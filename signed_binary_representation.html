                    <p>In mathematics, positive numbers (including zero) are represented as unsigned numbers. That is we
                        do not
                        put
                        the +ve sign in front of them to show that they are positive numbers.</p>
                    <p>However, when dealing with negative numbers we do use a -ve sign in front of the number to show
                        that the
                        number is negative in value and different from a positive unsigned value, and the same is true
                        with
                        <strong>signed binary numbers</strong>.</p>
                    <p>However, in digital circuits there is no provision made to put a plus or even a minus sign to a
                        number,
                        since
                        digital systems operate with binary numbers that are represented in terms of “0’s” and “1’s”.
                        When used
                        together in microelectronics, these “1’s” and “0’s”, called a <b>bit</b> (being a contraction of
                        <b>BI</b>nary digi<b>T</b>), fall into several range sizes of numbers which are referred to by
                        common
                        names,
                        such as a <em>byte</em> or a <em>word</em>.</p>
                    <p>We have also seen previously that an 8-bit binary number (a byte) can have a value ranging from 0
                        (00000000<sub>2</sub>) to 255 (11111111<sub>2</sub>), that is 2<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;256
                        different
                        combinations of bits forming a single 8-bit byte. So for example an unsigned binary number such
                        as:
                        01001101<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;64&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;77<sub>10</sub>
                        in
                        decimal. But Digital Systems and computers must also be able to use and to manipulate negative
                        numbers
                        as
                        well as positive numbers.</p>
                    <p>Mathematical numbers are generally made up of a sign and a value (magnitude) in which the sign
                        indicates
                        whether the number is positive, (&nbsp;<span class="ntxt">+</span>&nbsp;) or negative,
                        (&nbsp;<span class="ntxt">–</span>&nbsp;) with the value indicating the size of the number, for
                        example 23, +156
                        or
                        -274. Presenting numbers is this fashion is called “sign-magnitude” representation since the
                        left most
                        digit
                        can be used to indicate the sign and the remaining digits the magnitude or value of the number.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sign-magnitude notation is the simplest and one of the most common methods of representing
                        positive and
                        negative numbers either side of zero, (<span class="ntxt">0</span>). Thus negative numbers are
                        obtained
                        simply by changing the sign of the corresponding positive number as each positive or unsigned
                        number
                        will
                        have a signed opposite, for example, +2 and -2, +10 and -10, etc.</p>
                    <p>But how do we represent signed binary numbers if all we have is a bunch of one’s and zero’s. We
                        know that
                        binary digits, or bits only have two values, either a “1” or a “0” and conveniently for us, a
                        sign also
                        has
                        only two values, being a “<b>+</b>” or a “<b>–</b>“.</p>
                    <p>Then we can use a single bit to identify the sign of a <em>signed binary number</em> as being
                        positive or
                        negative in value. So to represent a positive binary number (<span class="ntxt">+n</span>) and a
                        negative
                        (<span class="ntxt">-n</span>) binary number, we can use them with the addition of a sign.</p>
                    <p>For signed binary numbers the most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit. If the sign bit
                        is “0”,
                        this means the number is positive in value. If the sign bit is “1”, then the number is negative
                        in
                        value.
                        The remaining bits in the number are used to represent the magnitude of the binary number in the
                        usual
                        unsigned binary number format way.</p>
                    <p>Then we can see that the Sign-and-Magnitude (SM) notation stores positive and negative values by
                        dividing
                        the
                        “n” total bits into two parts: 1 bit for the sign and n–1 bits for the value which is a pure
                        binary
                        number.
                        For example, the decimal number 53 can be expressed as an 8-bit signed binary number as follows.

                    <p>The disadvantage here is that whereas before we had a full range <span class="ntxt">n-bit</span>
                        unsigned
                        binary number, we now have an <span class="ntxt">n-1 bit</span> signed binary number giving a
                        reduced
                        range
                        of digits from:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span
                            class="mtxt">-2<sup>(n-1)</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;+2<sup>(n-1)</sup></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>So for example: if we have 4 bits to represent a signed binary number, (1-bit for the <b>Sign
                            bit</b> and
                        3-bits for the <b>Magnitude bits</b>), then the actual range of numbers we can represent in
                        sign-magnitude
                        notation would be:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span
                            class="mtxt">-2<sup>(4-1)</sup>&nbsp;–&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+2<sup>(4-1)</sup>&nbsp;–&nbsp;1</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span
                            class="mtxt">-2<sup>(3)</sup>&nbsp;–&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+2<sup>(3)</sup>&nbsp;–&nbsp;1</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span
                            class="mtxt">-7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+7</span></p>
                    <p>Whereas before, the range of an unsigned 4-bit binary number would have been from <span
                            class="ntxt">0</span>
                        to <span class="ntxt">15</span>, or <span class="ntxt">0</span> to <span class="ntxt">F</span>
                        in
                        hexadecimal, we now have a reduced range of -7 to +7. Thus an unsigned binary number does not
                        have a
                        single
                        sign-bit, and therefore can have a larger binary range as the most significant bit (MSB) is just
                        an
                        extra
                        bit or digit rather than a used sign bit.</p>
                    <p>Another disadvantage here of the sign-magnitude form is that we can have a positive result for
                        zero, +0
                        or
                        0000<sub>2</sub>, and a negative result for zero, -0 or 1000<sub>2</sub>. Both are valid but
                        which one
                        is
                        correct.</p>

                    <p>Note that for a 4-bit, 6-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit signed binary number all the bits MUST have
                        a
                        value,
                        therefore “0’s” are used to fill the spaces between the leftmost sign bit and the first or
                        highest value
                        “1”.</p>
                    <p>The sign-magnitude representation of a binary number is a simple method to use and understand for
                        representing signed binary numbers, as we use this system all the time with normal decimal (base
                        10)
                        numbers
                        in mathematics. Adding a “1” to the front of it if the binary number is negative and a “0” if it
                        is
                        positive.</p>
                    <p>However, using this sign-magnitude method can result in the possibility of two different bit
                        patterns
                        having
                        the same binary value. For example, <span class="ntxt">+0</span> and <span
                            class="ntxt">-0</span> would
                        be
                        <span class="ntxt">0000</span> and <span class="ntxt">1000</span> respectively as a signed 4-bit
                        binary
                        number. So we can see that using this method there can be two representations for zero, a
                        positive zero
                        (&nbsp;<span class="ntxt">0</span><span class="mtxt">000<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;) and also a
                        negative
                        zero
                        (&nbsp;<span class="ntxt">1</span><span class="mtxt">000<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;) which can
                        cause big
                        complications for computers and digital systems.</p>
                    <h2>One’s Complement of a Signed Binary Number</h2>
                    <p><strong>One’s Complement</strong> or <strong>1’s Complement</strong> as it is also termed, is
                        another
                        method
                        which we can use to represent negative binary numbers in a signed binary number system. In one’s
                        complement,
                        positive numbers (also known as non-complements) remain unchanged as before with the
                        sign-magnitude
                        numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Negative numbers however, are represented by taking the one’s complement (inversion, negation) of
                        the
                        unsigned positive number. Since positive numbers always start with a “0”, the complement will
                        always
                        start
                        with a “1” to indicate a negative number.</p>
                    <p>The one’s complement of a negative binary number is the complement of its positive counterpart,
                        so to
                        take
                        the one’s complement of a binary number, all we need to do is change each bit in turn. Thus the
                        one’s
                        complement of “1” is “0” and vice versa, then the one’s complement of <span
                            class="ntxt">10010100<sub>2</sub></span> is simply <span
                            class="ntxt">01101011<sub>2</sub></span> as
                        all
                        the 1’s are changed to 0’s and the 0’s to 1’s.</p>
                    <p>The easiest way to find the one’s complement of a signed binary number when building digital
                        arithmetic
                        or
                        logic decoder circuits is to use <a class="inlink" href="/logic/logic_4.html">Inverters</a>. The
                        inverter is
                        naturally a complement generator and can be used in parallel to find the 1’s complement of any
                        binary
                        number
                        as shown.</p>

                    <p>Then we can see that it is very easy to find the one’s complement of a binary number <span
                            class="ntxt">N</span> as all we need do is simply change the 1’s to 0’s and the 0’s to 1’s
                        to give
                        us a
                        <span class="ntxt">-N</span> equivalent. Also just like the previous sign-magnitude
                        representation,
                        one’s
                        complement can also have n-bit notation to represent numbers in the range from: <span
                            class="ntxt">-2<sup>(n-1)</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and<span
                            class="ntxt">&nbsp;&nbsp;+2<sup>(n-1)</sup> –
                            1</span>. For example, a 4-bit representation in the one’s complement format can be used to
                        represent
                        decimal numbers in the range from -7 to +7 with two representations of zero: <span
                            class="ntxt">0000</span>
                        (+0) and <span class="ntxt">1111</span> (-0) the same as before.</p>
                    <h2>Addition and Subtraction Using One’s Complement</h2>
                    <p>One of the main advantages of <strong>One’s Complement</strong> is in the addition and
                        subtraction of two
                        binary numbers. In mathematics, subtraction can be implemented in a variety of different ways as
                        <span class="ntxt">A&nbsp;–&nbsp;B</span>, is the same as saying <span
                            class="ntxt">A&nbsp;+&nbsp;(-B)</span>
                        or <span class="ntxt">-B&nbsp;+&nbsp;A</span> etc. Therefore, the complication of subtracting
                        two binary
                        numbers can be performed by simply using addition.</p>
                    <p>We saw in the <a class="inlink" href="/combination/comb_7.html">Binary Adder</a> tutorial that
                        binary
                        addition follows the same rules as for the normal addition except that in binary there are only
                        two bits
                        (digits) and the largest digit is a “1”, (just as “9” is the largest decimal digit) thus the
                        possible

                        1”
                        then the sum is equal to “0” plus a carry “1”. Let’s look at a simple example.</p>
                    <h2>Subtraction of Two Binary Numbers</h2>
                    <p>An 8-bit digital system is required to subtract the following two numbers 115 and 27 from each
                        other
                        using
                        one’s complement. So in decimal this would be: <span
                            class="ntxt">115&nbsp;–&nbsp;27&nbsp;=&nbsp;88</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>First we need to convert the two decimal numbers into binary and make sure that each number has
                        the same
                        number of bits by adding leading zero’s to produce an 8-bit number (byte). Therefore:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span class="mtxt">115<sub>10</sub></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;in binary
                        is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mtxt" style="letter-spacing: 0.2em;">01110011<sub>2</sub></span></p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span class="mtxt">27<sub>10</sub></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in binary
                        is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mtxt" style="letter-spacing: 0.2em;">00011011<sub>2</sub></span></p>
                    <p>Now we need to find the complement of the second binary number, (<span
                            class="ntxt">00011011</span>)
                        while
                        leaving the first number (<span class="ntxt">01110011</span>) unchanged. So by changing all the
                        1’s to
                        0’s
                        and 0’s to 1’s, the one’s complement of <span class="ntxt">00011011</span> is therefore equal to
                        <span class="ntxt">11100100</span>.</p>
                    <p>Adding the first number and the complement of the second number gives:</p>

                        can be ignored completely or passed to the next digital section for use in its calculations.
                        Overflow
                        indicates that the answer is positive. If there is no overflow then the answer is negative.</p>
                    <p>The 8-bit result from above is: <span class="mtxt">01010111</span> (the overflow “1” cancels out)
                        and to
                        convert it back from a one’s complement answer to the real answer we now have to add “1” to the
                        one’s
                        complement result, therefore:</p>

                    <p>So the result of subtracting 27 ( <span class="mtxt">00011011<sub>2</sub></span> ) from 115 (
                        <span class="mtxt">01110011<sub>2</sub></span> ) using 1’s complement in binary gives the answer

                    <p>Then we can see that signed or unsigned binary numbers can be subtracted from each other using
                        <strong>One’s
                            Complement</strong> and the process of addition. Binary adders such as the TTL 74LS83 or

                        be

                    <h2>Two’s Complement of a Signed Binary Number</h2>
                    <p><strong>Two’s Complement</strong> or <strong>2’s Complement</strong> as it is also termed, is
                        another
                        method
                        like the previous sign-magnitude and one’s complement form, which we can use to represent
                        negative
                        binary
                        numbers in a signed binary number system. In two’s complement, the positive numbers are exactly
                        the same
                        as
                        before for unsigned binary numbers. A negative number, however, is represented by a binary
                        number, which
                        when added to its corresponding positive equivalent results in zero.</p>
                    <p>In two’s complement form, a negative number is the 2’s complement of its positive number with the
                        subtraction
                        of two numbers being <span class="ntxt">A&nbsp;–&nbsp;B&nbsp;=&nbsp;A&nbsp;+&nbsp;( 2’s
                            complement of B
                            )</span> using much the same process as before as basically, two’s complement is one’s
                        complement +
                        1.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main advantage of two’s complement over the previous one’s complement is that there is no
                        double-zero
                        problem plus it is a lot easier to generate the two’s complement of a signed binary number.
                        Therefore,
                        arithmetic operations are relatively easier to perform when the numbers are represented in the
                        two’s
                        complement format.</p>
                    <p>Let’s look at the subtraction of our two 8-bit numbers 115 and 27 from above using two’s
                        complement, and
                        we
                        remember from above that the binary equivalents are:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span class="mtxt">115<sub>10</sub></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;in binary
                        is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mtxt" style="letter-spacing: 0.2em;">01110011<sub>2</sub></span></p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span class="mtxt">27<sub>10</sub></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in binary
                        is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="mtxt" style="letter-spacing: 0.2em;">00011011<sub>2</sub></span></p>
                    <p>Our numbers are 8-bits long, then there are 2<sup>8</sup> digits available to represent our
                        values and in
                        binary this equals: <span class="mtxt">100000000<sub>2</sub></span> or <span
                            class="ntxt">256<sub>10</sub></span>. Then the two’s complement of 27<sub>10</sub> will be:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span
                            class="mtxt">(2<sup>8</sup>)<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;–&nbsp;00011011&nbsp;=&nbsp;100000000&nbsp;–&nbsp;00011011&nbsp;=&nbsp;11100101<sub>2</sub></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The complementation of the second negative number means that the subtraction becomes a much
                        easier
                        addition
                        of the two numbers so therefore the sum is: <span class="ntxt">115&nbsp;+&nbsp;( 2’s complement
                            of 27
                            )</span> which is:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><span class="mtxt">01110011&nbsp;+&nbsp;11100101&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span><span
                            class="ntxt"><b>1</b></span>&nbsp;<span class="mtxt">01011000<sub>2</sub></span></p>
                    <p>As previously, the 9th overflow bit is disregarded as we are only interested in the first 8-bits,
                        so the
                        result is: <span class="mtxt">01011000<sub>2</sub></span> or (64 + 16 + 8) = 88<sub>10</sub> in
                        decimal
                        the
                        same as before.</p>
                    <h2>Signed Binary Numbers Summary</h2>
                    <p>We have seen that negative binary numbers can be represented by using the most significant bit
                        (MSB) as a
                        sign bit. If an <span class="ntxt">n bit</span> binary number is signed the leftmost bit is used
                        to
                        represent the sign leaving <span class="ntxt">n-1 bits</span> to represent the number.</p>
                    <p>For example, in a 4-bit binary number, this leaves only 3 bits to hold the actual number. If
                        however, the
                        binary number is unsigned then all the bits can be used to represent the number.</p>
                    <p>The representation of a signed binary number is commonly referred to as the <em>sign-magnitude
                            notation</em>
                        and if the sign bit is “0”, the number is positive. If the sign bit is “1”, then the number is
                        negative.
                        When dealing with binary arithmetic operations, it is more convenient to use the complement of
                        the
                        negative
                        number.</p>
                    <p>Complementation is an alternative way of representing negative binary numbers. This alternative
                        coding
                        system
                        allows for the subtraction of negative numbers by using simple addition.</p>
                    <p>Since positive sign-magnitude numbers always start with a zero (0), its complement will therefore
                        always
                        start with a one (1) to indicate a negative number as shown in the following table.</p>

                    <p>Signed-complement forms of binary numbers can use either 1’s complement or 2’s complement. The
                        1’s
                        complement
                        and the 2’s complement of a binary number are important because they permit the representation
                        of
                        negative
                        numbers.</p>
                    <p>The method of 2’s complement arithmetic is commonly used in computers to handle negative numbers
                        the only
                        disadvantage is that if we want to represent negative binary numbers in the signed binary number
                        format,
                        we
                        must give up some of the range of the positive number we had before.</p>
